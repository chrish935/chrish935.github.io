## Bio

I was originally a classically trained biochemist, but I've grown more & more into a bioinformatician over the years. I'm currently an [APHL Fellow](https://www.aphl.org/Career-Pathways/fellowships/Pages/default.aspx) at the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) where I build & utilize computational tools to better understand biological data so that our public health systems can be ready to handle the spread of disease. Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out with my cats, reading a good book, and seeking out new culinary experiences.
